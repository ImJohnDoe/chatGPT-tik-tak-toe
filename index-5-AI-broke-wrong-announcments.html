    <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <p>To play the game, click on an empty square to place your game piece (X or O). The first player to get three of
        their
        game pieces in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the
        game
        is a draw.</p>
